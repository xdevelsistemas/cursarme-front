# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.

# This must be changed for production, but we recommend not changing it in this file.

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
application.langs="pt-BR"

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `conf/my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and `conf/routes`)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
#db.default.driver=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
#db.default.url="jdbc:sqlserver://mssql.xduka.com.br:1433;databaseName=xDukaDev"
#db.default.user=xdevel
#db.default.password="xdevelsystem"
#
# You can expose this datasource via JNDI if needed (Useful for JPA)

#ESSAS DUAS LINHAS SÃO MUITO IMPORTANTES, ELA QUE ESTABELECE SUA LIGAÇÃO PRINCIPAL COM O PROJETO
db.default.jndiName=DefaultDS
jpa.default=defaultPersistenceUnit
jpa.debugSQL=true
# For debugging generated sql statements
db.default.logStatements=true
logger.com.jolbox=DEBUG

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
evolutionplugin=enabled

# Ebean configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many Ebean servers as you want.
# By convention, the default server is named `default`
#
# ebean.default="models.*"

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=DEBUG

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=DEBUG

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG
